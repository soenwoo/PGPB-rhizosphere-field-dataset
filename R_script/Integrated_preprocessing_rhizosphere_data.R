# =========================================================
# Integrated Preprocessing Code
# This code should be run before any analyses such as fig4, fig5, and fig6.
# It preprocesses and filters the data to prepare it for further analysis.
# Please run this code first before starting any specific analysis.
# =========================================================

# =========================================================
# Directory Setup for Farm-Specific Analysis
# This script requires farm-specific analysis. 
# For each farm, make sure to set the working directory correctly.
# For example, if analyzing data for "EK1", the working directory should be set as follows:
# setwd("./../Kale/EK1/") 
# Change the directory based on the farm you are analyzing.
# Ensure that the relevant data files are in the corresponding farm directory.
# =========================================================

# Example for setting working directory for a specific farm:
# setwd("./../Kale/EK1/")  # Set the working directory to the EK1 folder
# setwd("./../green_lettuce/EL4/")  # Set the working directory to the EL4 folder

# Load necessary libraries

### READ THE REQUIRED OTU, TAXONOMY, META DATA FILES

### Change the Taxonomy Ranks
colnames(tax_table(ps_data)) = c("Kingdom", "Phylum", "Class", "Order", "Family", "Genus", "Species")

### Remove the patterns of taxonomy classification names [k__/p__/c__/o__/f__/g__/s__]

  gsub(tax_table(ps_data)[, colnames(tax_table(ps_data))],

### Data preprocessing steps
## If you wish to apply any filters at any taxonomy level
## then please uncomment respective lines below and run accordingly
tax_filt = ps_data %>%
  subset_taxa(Kingdom != "Archaea") %>%         # Remove Archaea
  subset_taxa(Kingdom != "Unassigned") %>%

## Normalize to Even depth

## Remove taxa not seen more than 3 times in at least 20% of the samples.
## This protects against an OTU with small mean & trivially large C.V.

# Preprocessing for Fig 4A: Relative Abundance at Phylum Level
# This code processes the relative abundance (RA) data at the Phylum level.
# It normalizes the abundance, groups the data at the Phylum level, 
# and filters out taxa with RA below 0.01.
# The processed data is saved as "phylum_RA.csv" for further use in Fig 4A.
